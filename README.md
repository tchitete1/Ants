# Ants vs. Bees

Ants vs. Bees is a Python GUI-based tower defence game.

## The Game

A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns. In each turn, new bees may enter the ant colony. Then, new ants are 
placed to defend their colony. Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions. Bees either try to move toward 
the end of the tunnel or sting ants in their way. Ants perform a different action depending on their type, such as collecting 
more food, or throwing leaves at the bees. The game ends either when a bee reaches the end of a tunnel (you lose), or the 
entire bee fleet has been vanquished (you win).
